# STANCE

Welcome, voters!

STANCE is a quiz-based app that simplifies the voting decision process by allowing users to “match” with presidential candidates. The quiz returns the candidates who most closely reflect the user's views on a spectrum of current political issues. 

The target population for this app is anyone who wants to know which candidate they most closely align with politically or remove implicit bias when determining who will get their vote. However, it’s safe to say that it will largely target Americans who are Democrats (at least in 2019/2020) between the ages of 18 and 50. 

To start, voters take a brief quiz covering a broad swath of political hot button issues. Upon submitting, the voter's scores are compared to the scores of 17 candidates for the 2020 Presidential Election. Voters are returned images and names of their candidates, starting with their closest match running through their least similar match.
