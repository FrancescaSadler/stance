# STANCE

Welcome, voters!

STANCE is an app that simplifies the voting process to help you find your true candidate match.

To start, voters take a brief quiz covering a broad swath of political hot button issues. Upon submitting, the voter's scores are compared to the scores of 17 candidates for the 2020 Presidential Election. Voters are returned images and names of their top 5 candidates. Then, the voter can scroll through daily tweets from their top 5 best match candidates and swipe left or right based on how they feel in response to the tweet. The catch is, the candidates' identifying information is removed, thus reducing any implicit bias and giving the voter a more accurrate political match based on the issues themselves. Scores are reconfigured on the back end
